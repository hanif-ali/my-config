## My Config
*A Collection of Configuration Files and Scripts that I use to customize my Environment*


#### Configuration Files
- [Vimrc File](vimrc):  Includes Autocompletion Engine, Plugins, Colorscheme and other tweaks
- [Tmux Configuration File](tmux.conf): Vim Keybindings and Color Correction
- [Readline inputrc File](inputrc): Use Vim Keybindings and Rectify Ctrl-L Clear Screen

** Note: Hidden Files on Linux that start with a period (e.g., `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf`) have the starting period stripped for making it explicit in the repo. **
